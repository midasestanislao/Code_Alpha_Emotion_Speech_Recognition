This night Is cold In the kingdom,
I can feel you fade away
from the kitchen to the bathroom sink and your steps keep me awake
don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
so please, please
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
if your leaving baby let me down slowly
let me down. down
let me down. let me down. down. let me down. down
let me down. let me down. down. let me down
if you wanna go then I`ll be so lonely
if you`re leaving baby let me down slowly
cold skin. drag me feet on the tile as I`m walking down the corridor
and I know we haven`t talked in a while so I`m looking for an open door
don`t cut me down. throw me out. leave me here to waste
I once was a man. with dignity and grace
now I`m slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
so please
please
could you find a way to let me down slowly
a little sympathy, I hope you can  show me
if you wanna go then I`ll be so lonely
if you`re leaving baby let me down slowly
let me down. down
Let me down. Down. Let me down. Let me down. Down. Let me down. Down. Let me down.
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly
And I can't stop myself from falling- Down
And I can't can't stop myself from falling- Down
And I can't stop myself from falling- Down
And I can't stop myself from falling- Down
could you find a way to let me down slowly?
a little sympathy. i hope you can show me
if you wanna go then i`ll be so lonely
if you`re leaving baby let me down slowly
let me down. down
Let me down. Down. Let me down. Let me down. Down. Let me down. Down. Let me down.
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly
if you wanna go then i`ll be so lonely
if you`re leaving baby let me down slowly
